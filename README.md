# Assessment: I don't have time for this

Imagine that you've been working on this program on a team of developers. You've
done all the right things up until now, including writing [doctests](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/doctest.html)[1]
and [unitests](tests/test_anagrams.py).

Unfortunately, a previous teammate not only committed code that made the
benchmarking tests fail, but they force pushed to master after rewriting
history, so you can't simply go back in the git history to fix things.
Especially since, in the process of ruining the timings, the developer _did_
manage to implement features that weren't there before.

Your task is to modify [anagrams.py](anagrams.py) such that the tests pass
again. If the problem isn't obvious to you by examining the `anagrams.py`
module, consider using the profiling techniques that you learned about in the
lesson to pin down the problem. Using a debugger may also help you to get a
handle on exactly _why_ things are slow.

## Skipped unit test

If you look at the test case, you'll notice that the `test_long` unit test is
currently being skipped. That's because if it were to run with the current
implementation of `find_anagrams` it would take several minutes to complete. We
suggest that you try and get the `test_short` to pass first, then remove the
`@skip` line and ensure that the tests still pass.

Good luck!

[1] You can run the doctests with the following command:

```console
foo@bar:~ $ python2 -m doctest -v anagrams.py words/short.txt
```

To test the actual speed run the actual unittest rerun "python -m unittest discover"
